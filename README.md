# Discord Presence Widget

This little React app uses Material UI and the Lanyard API to show a little widget with the avatar, name, and status of a Discord user. The user's ID must be supplied through the URL with a query param (?user_id=\<User ID here\>).

Simple as that, nothing fancy.

## Usage

Navigate to: https://erstongreatman.github.io/discord-presence/?user_id=your_user_id

Boil it, mash it, stick it in a stew, or an iframe.
