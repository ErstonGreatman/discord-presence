/**
 * Determines the primary activity or action to be displayed from a list of activities,

 *
 * @param {Activity[] | undefined} activities - An array of activity objects or undefined if no activities are available.
 * @returns {ActivityAction | null} The primary activity action to display, or `null` if no activities are available.
 *
 * The function performs the following operations:
 * 1. If the `activities` array is undefined, it immediately returns `null`.
 * 2. Searches the `activities` array for any streaming activities (type `ACTIVITY_TYPES.STREAMING`).
 *    - If a streaming activity is found, it constructs an `ActivityAction` object with details such as the streaming platform, duration, activity details, and optional game information if available.
 * 3. If no streaming activities are found, it falls back to using the first activity in the array to construct an `ActivityAction`.
 * 4. Includes auxiliary details such as elapsed time, activity state, game details, and party size, where applicable.
 *
 * Note that the function assumes only a single streaming activity is of relevance at a time,
 * and it defaults to the first streaming activity if there are multiple present. Mostly because I'm pretty sure Discord
 * only recognizes Twitch at the moment.
